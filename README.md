# Project: 2048 Game - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## 📌 Introduction
This project is an implementation of the **2048 Game** as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course. The goal is to develop the game using efficient data structures and algorithms while ensuring smooth gameplay and functionality.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement the **2048 Game** using C++ and SFML.
- Apply various **data structures** such as arrays, linked lists, and trees.
- Utilize **algorithms** for game logic, undo/redo, and scoring.
- Store user data using **binary files**.
- Implement a **menu system** with options like New Game, Resume, and Top Players.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Graphics Library:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📜 Features
- **Interactive Console & GUI**: Console-based gameplay with a graphical interface using SFML.
- **User Login System**: Players must log in before starting a new game.
- **Undo & Redo Functionality**: Allows users to revert moves without using a stack.
- **Resume Feature**: Saves the current game state and allows users to continue later.
- **Top Player Leaderboard**: Stores and displays the highest scores.
